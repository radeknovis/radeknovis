### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Additionally, I have experience in other mobile technologies, including Flutter, allowing me to create cross-platform apps. Furthermore, I have contributed to the development of Node.js microservices (BFFs as in Backend for frontend), demonstrating my ability to work with back-end technologies.
